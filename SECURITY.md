## Reporting a Vulnerability

The SoarZip team and community take all security vulnerabilities seriously. Thank you for improving the security of our project. We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

We prefer security reports to be submitted privately.

**Please report security vulnerabilities by using GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature.** You can find this option in the "Security" tab of our repository.

Alternatively, if you prefer, you can report security vulnerabilities by emailing the lead maintainer directly at [artaphy@foxmail.com].

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

When reporting a vulnerability, please include the following details:

*   A clear description of the vulnerability.
*   Steps to reproduce the vulnerability (including any sample code or files if applicable).
*   The version(s) of SoarZip affected.
*   Potential impact of the vulnerability.
*   Any suggested mitigation or fix, if you have one.

## Our Commitment

After you report a vulnerability, we commit to:

*   Acknowledging receipt of your vulnerability report within 3 business days.
*   Providing an estimated timeframe for addressing the vulnerability report.
*   Notifying you when the vulnerability is fixed.

We strive to resolve all security issues as quickly as possible. We will keep you informed of our progress throughout the process.

Thank you for helping keep SoarZip and its users safe.
